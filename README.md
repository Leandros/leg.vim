> LEG syntax highlighting for ViM

[Parsing Expression Grammar](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsing_expression_grammar) syntax for vim, modified to
reflect the [LEG](http://piumarta.com/software/peg/) dialect.

Unlike other LEG.vim highlighters, this highlighter has robust support for the C/C++ inner highlighting as well as
the end-pattern delimiter (`%%`).

## Install

Install it with [Plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug):

```viml
Plug 'Qix-/leg.vim'
```
